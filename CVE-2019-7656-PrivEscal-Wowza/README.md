# CVE-2019-7656-PrivEscal-Wowza
A privilege escalation vulnerability in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.7 build 20181108145350 and 4.7.8 build 20191105123929, allows any unprivileged Linux user to escalate privileges to root. The installer sets too relaxed permissions on core program files. By injecting the payload in one of those files, it will run with same privileges as the Wowza server, root.


### Evidence
