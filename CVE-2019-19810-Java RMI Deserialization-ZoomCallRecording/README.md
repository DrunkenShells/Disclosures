# CVE-2019-19810: Java RMI Deserialization of Untrusted Data in Zoom Call Recording

Zoom Call Recording 6.3.1 from [ZOOM International](https://www.zoomint.com/solutions/call-recording) is vulnerable to Java Deserialization attacks targeting the inbuilt RMI service.
<br/>
A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted RMI request to execute arbitrary code on the target host.
<br/>

### Exploitation Techniques:

Because the RMI service was protected by JEP 290, the vulnerability could not be directly exploited using ysoserial.
<br/>
In order to bypass this security measure, one of 2 techniques can used:

- Direct Object Insertion into Function Arguments
- "Bypassing" Argument Type Safety

#### Direct Object Insertion into Function Arguments

In order to use this technique, an attacker needs to find at least 1 remote method that accepts an arbitrary object, or variant (Ex. Array of objects, etc.) as argument.
<br/>
Full description and scripts can be found [here](The%20Easy%20Way)


#### "Bypassing" Argument Type Safety

This technique requires a more complex setup to perform the exploit, but it can be used on any remote method that takes at least 1 argument. 
<br/>
Full description and scripts can be found [here](The%20Hard%20Way)

### Conclusion
Both the above techniques result in Remote Code Execution if performed correctly.
